Hey there people,

I am a geospatial analyst with a background in GIS, remote sensing, and environmental management. I completed my undergraduate studies at Institut Teknologi Bandung and am currently pursuing a Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management at the University of British Columbia. My academic and professional interests focus on LiDAR-based forest structure and carbon estimation, land-use and land-cover analysis, and spatial decision support for conservation and sustainable development. I have experience supporting national-level policy analysis in Indonesia, where I translate complex geospatial data into clear, actionable insights for forest, land, and water resource management
